# Madeline v2 Documentations 

This website is built using [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). A fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.

### Installation

```
$ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn dev
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

We're using Vercel to deploy our site. It's handled by our Github Actions.
