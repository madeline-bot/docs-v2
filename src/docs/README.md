Welcome to Madeline's documentation. Here you may learn yourself a thing or two about the bot.

## Introduction

Madeline is a multifunctional Discord bot that offers countless amounts of features such as track your favorite SA-MP servers, search the SA-MP Wiki (powered by open.mp), and just so much more.

## Getting Started

Firstly, make sure that Madeline is in the server you are looking to use it in. If not, you may invite it by clicking [here](/invite).

Madeline is by default only asking for the permissions required for it to work, we highly recommend you to make sure you are inviting it with the required permissions, otherwise, the bot may not work properly. If you want to know more details about why we are asking for specific permissions, read the [FAQ](/docs/faq).

## Configuration

Once Madeline has been invited on your server, if you invited it with the required permissions, it will be ready to use!
